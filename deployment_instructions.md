# Deployment Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to deploy the Smart Traffic Management System on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A Google Cloud Platform account
- The Google Cloud SDK installed on your local machine
- Python 3.7 or later installed on your local machine
- Access to the Google Cloud Console

## Step 1: Set up your Google Cloud Project

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console.
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.
3. Enable the necessary APIs for your project: Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud Dataflow, Google Cloud AI Platform, Google App Engine, and Google Maps API.
4. Note down your project ID as you will need it in the following steps.

## Step 2: Set up Google Cloud Pub/Sub

1. Navigate to the Pub/Sub section in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Create the necessary topics and subscriptions as defined in the `pubsub_ingestion.py`, `dataflow_processing.py`, `ai_model.py`, `optimization_algorithm.py`, `dashboard.py`, and `alert_system.py` files.

## Step 3: Set up Google Cloud Dataflow

1. Navigate to the Dataflow section in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Create a new Dataflow job using the `dataflow_processing.py` script.

## Step 4: Set up Google Cloud AI Platform

1. Navigate to the AI Platform section in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Create a new model using the `ai_model.py` script.

## Step 5: Set up Google App Engine

1. Navigate to the App Engine section in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Create a new App Engine application using the `dashboard.py` script.

## Step 6: Deploy the Application

1. Open the Google Cloud Shell.
2. Clone your project repository to the Cloud Shell environment.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Set your project ID with the following command: `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
5. Deploy your application with the following command: `gcloud app deploy`

## Step 7: Verify the Deployment

1. After the deployment is successful, you can access your application at `https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com`.
2. Verify that the application is working correctly by checking the real-time traffic data on the dashboard.

## Step 8: Set up the Alert System

1. Navigate to the Pub/Sub section in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Create a new subscription for the alert system using the `alert_system.py` script.

## Step 9: Test the System

1. Run the `test.py` script to test the system and ensure that it is working correctly.

## Step 10: Monitor the System

1. Monitor the system using the Google Cloud Console and the dashboard.
2. Check the logs regularly for any errors or issues.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the Smart Traffic Management System on Google Cloud Platform.
